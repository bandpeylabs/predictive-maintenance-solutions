# Engine RUL Predictor

This solution showcases predictive maintenance for engines, enabling the accurate prediction of an engineâ€™s Remaining Useful Life (RUL). It leverages advanced machine learning models built on a meticulously curated dataset that simulates real-world operational conditions.

The dataset includes precise measurements of critical parameters such as:

-	Air Temperature
-	Process Temperature
-	Rotational Speed
-	Torque
-	Tool Wear

Our system employs cutting-edge algorithms, including:

-	Random Forest
-	Decision Tree
-	Stochastic Gradient Boosting

These models work together to predict potential failures with high accuracy, empowering businesses to optimize maintenance schedules, reduce downtime, and extend engine life. This solution is ideal for industries relying on heavy machinery or aerospace applications where reliability is paramount.
