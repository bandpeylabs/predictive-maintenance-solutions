# CNC Predictive Maintenance

This solution showcase predictive maintenance on CNC machine.

CNC predictive maintenance solution is based on machine learning models built on a precisely produced dataset that accurately represents real-world machining circumstances.

This dataset, created by the School of Engineering - Technology and Life, correctly measures critical variables such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. Our system effectively predicts CNC machine failures using Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Stochastic Gradient Boosting algorithm
