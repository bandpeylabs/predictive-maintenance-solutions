# Manufacturing Analytics: Real-time Plant Performance Monitoring

<img style="float: right" width="600px" alt="Factory Operations Dashboard" src="images/factory-dashboard.png">

## Overview

This solution enables manufacturing companies to streamline operations and increase production capacity through real-time performance monitoring and analytics. By implementing intelligent data pipelines, plant managers can make data-driven decisions to optimize equipment performance and production efficiency.

## Key Features

- Real-time KPI monitoring and analytics
- Multi-factory performance tracking
- Equipment effectiveness measurement (OEE)
- Streaming data processing for sensor data
- Unified view of production metrics

## Business Value

Plant managers can:

- Monitor current equipment availability
- Track historical performance metrics
- Identify underperforming production lines
- Perform root cause analysis
- Make data-driven operational decisions

## Understanding OEE

Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is the manufacturing industry standard for measuring productivity, calculated using three key metrics:

1. **Availability** = (Healthy_time - Error_time)/(Total_time)

   - Measures operational uptime
   - Accounts for planned/unplanned stoppages

2. **Performance** = Healthy_time/Total_time

   - Measures production speed
   - Compares actual vs designed speed

3. **Quality** = (Total Parts - Defective Parts)/Total Parts
   - Measures yield
   - Tracks production quality

## Technical Architecture

The solution implements a multi-layer data architecture:

1. **Raw Layer**:

   - Ingests real-time sensor data
   - Captures IoT device readings
   - Processes streaming events

2. **Refined Layer**:

   - Cleanses incoming data
   - Extracts relevant metrics
   - Standardizes data format

3. **Analytics Layer**:
   - Calculates KPIs
   - Generates real-time insights
   - Powers visualization dashboards

## Implementation Details

- Streaming data processing for real-time analytics
- Scalable data pipeline architecture
- Production-ready monitoring solution
- Integration with existing manufacturing systems
